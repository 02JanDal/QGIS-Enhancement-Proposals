QEP Process and workflow
---

QEP's (QGIS Enhancement Proposals) are used in the process of creating and discussing new enhancements for QGiS.

Currently Github is used to centralize the discussion and edit's to a proposal.

All QEP's area created as new [issues](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues).  Create a new ticket using the [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/master/QEP-0-Template.md)

QEP's should generally be craeted for (only examples):

- Large application wide changes (e.g major UI redesign)
- Large worker with wider scope (e.g something that might effect how layers are loaded.)
- Community process and policys (e.g 3.0 release)

Generally smaller features do no require a QEP unless they can have large knock on effect.
