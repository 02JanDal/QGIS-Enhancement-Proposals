QEP Process and workflow
---

QEP's (QGIS Enhancement Proposals) are used in the process of creating and discussing new enhancements for QGiS.

Currently Github is used to centralize the discussion and edit's to a proposal.

All QEP's area created as new [issues](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues).  Create a new ticket using the [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/master/QEP-0-Template.md)
